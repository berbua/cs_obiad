# Music Placeholder

To add 8-bit music to your app:

1. Download free 8-bit/chiptune music from:
   - https://archive.org/details/8bitcollective
   - https://opengameart.org
   - https://freemusicarchive.org

2. Save the MP3 file as `retro.mp3` in this directory

3. The music player in the app will automatically load it

For now, the music player button will be visible but won't play anything until you add the file.
